Fossi Family Delice is a modern wood-fired family restaurant imagined by the two-star chef of the nonmee family Hortense Flore. Our spacious, elegantly designed space and refined menu are the ultimate expression of luxury and traditional dining. Serving handmade pastas, steaks and fresh seafood, the overall approach to preparation is light, fresh and technique-focused.

The heart of our restaurant is the wood-fired fireplace where you'll find fresh prawns charred to perfection alongside wood-fire roasted artichokes and fire-roasted octopus a la plancha - the entrees alone might steal the show.</p></div>
